This software was tested with Python 2.7, and should work for just about any version.

If you need to install Python and supporting libraries, follow the instructions included in the prerequisites directory of this software distribution.

Simply run test_Bijection_N_x_N_to_N.py and test_Bijection_N_x_N_x_N_to_N.py

*** Windows ***

In Windows, if Python is already installed right click on either test_Bijection_N_x_N_to_N.py or test_Bijection_N_x_N_x_N_to_N.py and select 'edit with IDLE' as your option. This will load the file in Python's native editer and debugging environment. Once loaded in IDLE, simply push F5 to run the simulation, this will in turn pop up a debugging console in which the results will be printed.

*** Linux/UNIX ***
in Unix or Unix like OSes issue the commands:

python test_Bijection_N_x_N_to_N.py

and

python test_Bijection_N_x_N_x_N_to_N.py

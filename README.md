Here we have included three examples corresponding to examples presented in sections 2 and 3 of the paper.

(1.) The DFA (deterministic finite automaton) D for recognizing strings in the language substring CoRR described in section 2 of the paper. And TM (Turing machine) for simulating the DFA D for determining whether strings are members of the language substring CoRR, also described in section 2 of the paper.

(2.) These Examples illustrating bijections for enumerating elements of finite sets, namely for showing the cardinality of the cartesian products of the Natural numbers. These examples are also in section 2 of the paper.

(3.) These examples, illustrate the deformation (energy minimization) of snakes (active contour models) using dynamic programming for computing the globally optimal minimum energy contour for a given parameter set. These are examples of snakes deformed on synthetic laryngeal kymographic image-gradient-magnitudes.

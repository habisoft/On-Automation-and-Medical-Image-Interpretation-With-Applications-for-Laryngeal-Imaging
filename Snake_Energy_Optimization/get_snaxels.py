The following is the source for a Python Active Contour (Snake) Snaxel class. A snake is a
type of computerized spline used in many fields such as image processing, computer
vision, and medical image analysis for extracting image features. As a snake's energy
is minimized, the snake-spline will deform towards salient image features like gradient
magnitude, image intensity, and even line terminations. The vertices that describe a snake
have been termed "snaxel', in this file, we implement a function for creating a vector of snaxels.
